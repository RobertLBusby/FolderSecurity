# FolderSecurity
A program to hide your folders, not very strong but protects them from the majority of idiots
USE:
1. click the SuperSecureMaster.bat file, a new folder will appear
2. place whatever in the newly created folder
3. click the SuperSecureMaster.bat file again, it will ask to lock the folder
4. type y and press enter, the folder will disappear
5. to get it back, just click the SuperSecureMaster.bat folder AGAIN
6. enter "password" as the password, to change it, change the fourth word of line 31, no spaces
7. your done
like i said, this is weak and very easily defeated, but it does mess with you if you get the password wrong
i dont suggest using this, i will eventually make a better version
or use it if you want, you downloaded it, i dont care, i just made it in my spare time during one of my college classes
